#Implement a class called LineAnalyzer.
class LineAnalyzer
  #Implement the following read-only attributes in the LineAnalyzer class.
  attr_reader :highest_wf_count #* highest_wf_count - a number with maximum number of occurrences for a single word (calculated)
  attr_reader :highest_wf_words #* highest_wf_words - an array of words with the maximum number of occurrences (calculated)
  attr_reader :content          #* content          - the string analyzed (provided)
  attr_reader :line_number      #* line_number      - the line number analyzed (provided)

  #Add the following methods in the LineAnalyzer class.
  #* initialize() - taking a line of text (content) and a line number
  #Implement the initialize() method to:
  #* take in a line of text and line number
  #* initialize the content and line_number attributes
  #* call the calculate_word_frequency() method.

    @content = content
    @line_number = line_number
    # automatically analyze the line which will populate the highest_wf_* vars
    calculate_word_frequency()
  end

  #Implement the calculate_word_frequency() method to:
  #* calculate the maximum number of times a single word appears within
  #  provided content and store that in the highest_wf_count attribute.
  #* identify the words that were used the maximum number of times and
  #  store that in the highest_wf_words attribute.

  # Implement the analyze_file() method() to:

  #* analyze_file() - processes 'test.txt' intro an array of LineAnalyzers and stores them in analyzers.
